In more advanced cases, you may want to incorporate the results of a sensitivity analysis into the optimisation itself, for example to find configurations which minimise variance in an aspect of interest, while potentially also optimising another aspect.\n",

Now that sensitivity analysis is performed, we no longer have a single value for the aspects we want to optimise; instead, we have a whole set of statistics about them (gathered from all the runs performed). This gives us access to more information, but also means that we cannot refer to the value of a variable of interest directly.\n",

To evaluate the fitness of a single set of variables, we instantiate multiple facilities, each parameterised differently. Therefore, we have no way of referring to a single facility, nor to the value of the cost for that particular instance. If we so wish, we can refer to its *average*, which will give an estimate of the cost across the different runs. For this reason, our optimisation objectives must be looked up on the sensitivity analyser rather than the facility.\n",
